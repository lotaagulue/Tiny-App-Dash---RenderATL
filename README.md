# Tiny App Dash — RenderATL 2025

Small, fun Python apps and mini-games created with GitHub Copilot for RenderATL 2025. Each script in this repository is a standalone app intended for learning, demoing ideas, or quick play.

**Highlights**
- A collection of lightweight, single-file Python apps and games.
- Screenshot gallery for each app in the `images/` folder.
- Quick to run locally with Python.

**Apps Included**
- **Click The Sneaker Game**: Click the sneaker on the screen to score points.
- **Countdown App**: Simple visual countdown timer.
- **Guess The Sneaker Game**: Guess which sneaker is shown.
- **Jumping Sneaker Game**: Platform-style jumping game.
- **Nike Slogan App**: Displays / cycles through slogan text.
- **Shoe Color Switcher**: Change shoe colors interactively.
- **Sneaker Dodge Game**: Avoid obstacles and collect points.
- **Sneaker Memory Game**: Classic memory/pairs game with sneaker images.
- **Sneaker Picker App**: Randomly pick sneakers from a list.
- **Sneaker Wish List**: Keep a simple wishlist of shoes.

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8 or newer.
- Many apps use `pygame` or standard libraries; if an app fails to run, try installing `pygame`:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

**How to run an app**

From the repository root run:

```bash
python click_the_sneaker_game.py
```

Replace the filename with any of the scripts in the root folder to run a different app (for example `sneaker_picker_app.py`). Each script is self-contained.
